Training Seminar: Modern Developer Workflow 🚀Welcome to the official repository for the February 14, 2026, Training Seminar. This project is designed to bridge the gap between academic coding and professional team-based IT development.Through this seminar, you will transform a "monolithic" legacy application into a modular, professional-grade project using Git, SOLID Principles, and AI-Assisted Programming.🎤 Speakers & TopicsSpeakerTopicFocusJan Dale ZarateGit 101 & VS CodeVersion control, branching, and team sync.Reynaldo Jr. FerrerPrompt EngineeringUsing AI to accelerate refactoring and coding.Carl EstradaSOLID FrameworkWriting maintainable, modular, and clean code.🛠 The Activity: "The Monolith Refactor"The current state of this repository is a Monolith. All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are crammed into a single index.html file. This makes the code hard to read, difficult to test, and impossible for a team to work on simultaneously without causing merge conflicts.Phase 1: Git FoundationsFork this repository to your own GitHub account.Clone your fork to your local machine via VS Code.Create a Branch: Create a new branch named refactor/solid-modules.Rule: Never work directly on main!Phase 2: Refactoring with AI (Prompt Engineering)Using the principles shared by Reynaldo, use an AI (ChatGPT/Gemini) to break the monolith apart.Goal: Extract the styles into style.css and the logic into script.js.Constraint: Apply the Single Responsibility Principle. The HTML should only handle structure, the CSS only design, and the JS only behavior.Phase 3: The "Teamwork" SimulationSyncing: Before finishing, simulate a team update by fetching and merging any changes from the original main branch.Conflict Resolution: If your refactor overlaps with a teammate's changes, use the VS Code Merge Editor to resolve the conflict.Commit & Push: Commit your changes with a descriptive message and push your branch to GitHub.📁 Repository Structure (After Refactor)Once you complete the activity, your project structure should look like this:Plaintext├── index.html     # Clean structure, links to CSS and JS
├── style.css      # All UI styling (Modularized)
├── script.js     # Business logic & event listeners
└── README.md      # This documentation
💡 Key Git Commands to Remembergit checkout -b <branch-name> : Create and switch to a new branch.git status : See which files are modified (M) or untracked (U).git add . : Stage your changes for a "save point."git commit -m "Your message" : Save your snapshot to the history.git pull origin main : Get the latest updates from the team.📝 Seminar NotesSOLID: A class or file should have one, and only one, reason to change.Prompting: Be specific. Tell the AI the context (Legacy HTML) and the target (Clean JS modules).Git: Commit often, pull frequently, and always communicate with your team.Seminar Date: February 14, 2026Target Audience: IT Student Interns
