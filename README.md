## 🛠️ The Activity: The Monolithic Guestbook Refactor

In this hands-on workshop, you will find a "Legacy" application in `index.html`. It is a functional guestbook, but it is a **Monolith**—the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all tangled in one file, violating the Single Responsibility Principle.

### **Objective**
Use **Git** to manage your workflow and **Prompt Engineering** to refactor the code according to **SOLID** principles.
